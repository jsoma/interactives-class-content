## A warning: versions

There are many different versions of D3, and each of them changes remarkably different things each time. Unlike using Stack Overflow for questions with Python tools like BeautifulSoup or pandas, there's a very good chance answers *won't work due to version differences.*

A cynic might say it's [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) in order to create a pipeline of people who will pay for [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). A realist might say that, too, as might someone who was previously really excited about trying to learn D3 but then ran into a thousand walls. Honestly, maybe everyone says it? But just incredibly quietly, because otherwise they'll get ravaged by mobs of people who find them unappreciative?
