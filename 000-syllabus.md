The goal of this course is to become familiar with the tooling for JavaScript-based visualization development, and know enough to learn more in whatever direction you choose.

You will *not* become a D3 expert, but you'll learn enough to adapt other peoples' code into your own visuals.

You will *not* become a fancy JS developer, but you'll learn enough to install and use libraries, along with being able to understand how to work within the confines of a graphics framework/build system.

## Week 1

**Prep work:** Find some pieces where you think, "is this D3?"
